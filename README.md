You're the CMO at a web3 company named "Kiwi News" and the plan is to grow the value of the company's ERC20 token, buy convincing people to buy it.

You have an idea for a Christmas themed campaign for your token titled $kiwimas . It's meant to be a Farcaster frame prompting people to share with 2 calls to action:

1. nominate someone naughty
2. nominate someone nice

Please write a suggested text for both options, with placeholders for the people who are about to be nominated.
